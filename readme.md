# New Digs

A simple app to run on your old domain to point all visitors at your new digs.

If you have a Heroku account, click the button below and on the setup screen be sure to fill in "REDIRECT_URL" with your new domain, for instance "http://someairplan.es" and be sure to not include the trailing slash. You can also put in "http://someairplan.es/oldsite" as this app catches paths and will redirect the full request into a dir.
